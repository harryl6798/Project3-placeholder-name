## Description
EECSurvival is a simple 2-d game. Taking some inspiration from bullet hell games such as The Binding of Isaac, each level consists of the character fighting one of the many EECS professors at ku for a good game. At the current stage of developement we are stilling creating and building on the engine itself, though we do have a working example of one boss. The boss is a simple rectangle that has a variety of firing effects and the character is a sprite that can move around and shoot back at the boss. There is a consumable that can be picked up to give the player more health as well.

### Controls
You can move the character around using the wasd keys, and you can shoot by pressing the space bar. To move to the next level you just need to run into the door sprite. 

## Menus

### Main Menu

When you first open the game you will be presented with the main menu. The play button will take you into the game and you will start fighting your way through the bosses. There are 3 buttons in the center for testing purposes and at the bottom there is the quit button which will take you out of the game. If you want to learn more about the testing functionality and the level go take a look at our level guide. 

### Pause Menu

During any gameplay you can press the escape key and it will open the pause menu. If you click the mute button and close the pause menu the music will no longer be playing. There is an option to go back to the main menu. WARNING: there is no progress saving feature and you will be required to start over from level 1. If you want to quit the game completely you have to go back to the main menu and then press quit.
