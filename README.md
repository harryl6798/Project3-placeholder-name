## Description
EECSurvival is a simple 2-d game. Taking some inspiration from bullet hell games such as The Binding of Isaac, each level consists of the character fighting one of the many EECS professors at ku for a good game. At the current stage of developement we are stilling creating and building on the engine itself, though we do have a working example of one boss. The boss is a simple rectangle that has a variety of firing effects and the character is a sprite that can move around and shoot back at the boss. There is a consumable that can be picked up to give the player more health as well.

### Controls
You can move the character around using the wasd keys, and you can shoot by pressing the space bar. To move to the next level you just need to run into the door sprite. 

### Downloading
We have ported this over to be easily runnable from a jar. You can download it at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fwehrksmysak06m/EECSurvival_PreAlpha.zip?dl=0
