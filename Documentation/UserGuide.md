## Controls

The controls for this game are very straightforward. To move up press W, to move left press A, to move right press D, and to move down press S. To shoot you can either tap or hold down the space bar. There is also a sprint feature. To sprint you need to hold down shift and then a movement and the player will move drastically faster, though you will be unable to shoot. To transition between levels, a door will appear at the top of the screen. Simply move into it and you will be taken to the next level. 

## Levels

EECSurvival takes place over 5 levels of heated combative gameplay. The student starts in 168, and then makes their way from 268, 368, 388, and ends at 448. Each level (or class) has a boss that is a model of the professor. EECS 168 and 268 are commanded by Professor John Gibbons. EECS 368 is defended by Professor Paul Cline. EECS 388 features Professor Gary Minden. And finally, EECS 448 is led by Professor Alex Bardas.

### Level 1 (EECS 168)

Programming 1. Where every great Computer Science major at KU began. When the player enters the level there is a small dialogue sequence that happens. Dr. Gibbons says "insert dialogue here" and then says "insert more dialogue here". From there the player returns to the starting position in the bottom middle of the screen and combat ensues. Professor Gibbons has three attacks. A wall attack, and burst attack, and a targeted attack. The wall attack is a straight line of projectiles that all falls down at the same rate. The burst attack is a half circle of projectiles that spreads throughout the screen. The targeted attack is a singular projectile that shoots towards the position that the player was standing when the projectile was shot. After defeating Dr. Gibbons in 168, you have to face him again in 268.

### Level 2 (EECS 268)

Programming 2. Where every great Computer Science major at KU begins to question their major decision. The level is very similar to level 1, and Professor Gibbons even has the same attacks, but the attacks are stronger and shoot more frequently. The projectiles also travel at a higher speed.
